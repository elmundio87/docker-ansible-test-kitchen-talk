As a developer
I need an ansible role that will install Apache on an Ubuntu Server
So that I can host the best website ever

Additional notes:

- Install whatever the latest version of Apache is, we're a bleeding edge company
- Must work on Ubuntu 14.04 (current) and 15.04 (future rollout)
- The external load balancer will be routed to port 55555 on all machines
- The NSA wants their own root account on all our environments
- Please disable telnet for maximum security
